Southpaw is currently: `IN DEVELOPMENT`

## Description

Southpaw is a full stack MERN web application built for mobile first. Similar to dating apps, Southpaw uses the same technology but for a whole different purpose.

## Technologies Used

- MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- jsonwebtoken - user auth
- multer - storing images
- MUI - react component library
- React Redux (Redux Toolkit) - global state management and persistence
- React Dropzone - image management
- Socket.io - direct messaging between users
- formik - form input
- yup - form input verification

## Usage

### Pre-Fight

- Pull up your feed to see new fighters.

- You can choose to pass or fight the fighters on your feed.

- If you choose to pass, you won't see them pop up in your feed for a while so choose wisely!

- If you choose to fight, and the other fighter chooses you as well, then it's a match!

### Fight

- You can chat with your matched users, remove the match, or end the fight

### Post-Fight

- Click on the end fight button in your chat.

- Both users MUST agree on the outcome of the fight within 24 hours.

- If both fighters agree, their records are updated automatically on their profile.

- If both fighters cannot agree on an outcome, both fighters will receive a strike. 1 Strike = Warning | 2 Strikes = 30 Day Ban | 3 Strikes = Permanent Ban.
